  <h2>Projects</h2>
  <ul>

    <li>
      <h4>Maleria Detection (10/2020)</h4>
      <strong>Description </strong>: 3 - Fine Tuned models named DenseNet, InceptionResNet and VGG19 were ensembled on max voting. They were fined
      tuned in order to give good accuracy.
      <br><strong>Learning </strong>: It learnt the working of convolution layer, and various algorithms used to minimize the loss functions.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Investigate TMDB Database (06/2020)</h4>
      <strong>Description </strong>: An exploratory analysis was carried out on TMDB (The Movie Database) using various python based libraries which
      includes pandas, numpy, sci-kit, matplotlib and seaborn. A tableau based story telling was created to present the results.
      <br><strong>Learning </strong>: I realized the power and importance of statistics. I learnt various exploratory and explanatory analysis techniques
      that are daily used by Data Analyst and Data Scientists in day to day life.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Breast Cancer Prediction (04/2020)</h4>
      <strong>Description </strong>: Various supervised learning classifiers were constructed and hypertuned to get the best classifier to predict the
      presence of breast cancer. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), SVM, Logistic Regression, Random Forest,Gaussian Naïve Bayes and Multilayer Perceptron.
      <br><strong>Learning </strong>: I learnt the few statistical concepts which are considered to compare results. I learnt how to tune hyperparameters
      for increasing the efficiency of the model.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Book Management System (06/2019)</h4>
      <strong>Description </strong>:Book Management System is the system which is used to sell and buy the books. This is a python based GUI project. Tkinter was used to create the GUI, whereas SQLite3 was used to implement
      Database. <br><strong>Learning </strong>:I learnt the importance of GUI, how to use python programming to create GUI based projects, how to create and normalize relational database using normalization techniques and how to implement it on the
      python
    </li>
  </ul>

  <h3>Certificates</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>
      <h4>Deep Learning Specialization (Coursera) (11/2020 - Present)</h4>
      This specialization contains foundations of Deep Learning and various deep learning models including CNNs, RNNs and LSTM. I learnt various approaches
      used to minimize the loss functions which includes Adam, Dropout, SGD and Gradient Descent with momentum.
    </li>
    <li>
    <h4>Programming For Data Science Nanodegree (Udacity) (06/2020)</h4>
    This nanodegree program consists of small courses on postgreSQL, python, excel and introduction to tableau.
    </li>
    <li>
      <h4>Business Analytics (Udacity) (07/2020)</h4>
      In this course, various tools used for carrying out analysis were covered which included advance python, postgreSQL and tableau for explanatory
      analysis
